	<p>Persistent Grid Framework will provide a solid base stylesheet for all your projects. It is configurable to produce the exact output you need - no less and certainly no more. Framework consists of five modules: Type, Baseline, Reset, Grid and Base.</p>
	<p><em>Type</em> produces no output but defines your project's typography settings.</p>
	<p><em>Baseline</em> is an implementation of Compass's Vertical Rhythm plugin.</p>
	<p><em>Reset</em> is a configurable reset so that your project can start of a clean, browser consistent slate.</p>
	<p><em>Grid</em> is a configurable and highly flexible layout system.</p>
	<p><em>Base</em> defines the base styles upon which you can extend.</p>
