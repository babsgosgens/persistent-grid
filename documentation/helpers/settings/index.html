<h1 class="chapter-heading">Presets</h1>

<p>The presets are to help you build your site more quickly. Like module settings, these can be overridden or extended by your project settings. The settings are grouped:</p>


<h2 class="paragraph-heading"><a href="https://github.com/babsgosgens/persistentgrid/blob/master/scss/pg/helpers/settings/_breakpoints.scss" target="github">Breakpoints</a></h2>
<p>
	Breakpoints help you implement consistent media queries. This is still under heavy construction and I am considering switching to Breakpoints instead as they&rsquo;re approach is much like what I had in mind (http://breakpoint-sass.com/).
</p>

<h2 class="paragraph-heading"><a href="https://github.com/babsgosgens/persistentgrid/blob/master/scss/pg/helpers/settings/_colors.scss" target="github">Colours</a></h2>
<p>
	All 140 color names as per the HTML and CSS color specification (http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_colornames.asp).
</p>

<h2 class="paragraph-heading"><a href="https://github.com/babsgosgens/persistentgrid/blob/master/scss/pg/helpers/settings/_font-sizes.scss" target="github">Font Sizes</a></h2>
<p>
	Font sizes implement consistent font sizes accross a project. Currently, font-sizes are under construction.
</p>

<h2 class="paragraph-heading"><a href="./fonts.html">Fonts</a></h2>
<p>
	This is where Persistent Grid&rsquo;s Type Lists are defined. A Type List is a list of type properties: <code>style</code>, <code>variation</code>, <code>weight</code>, <code>family</code>. They help you implement &ldquo;<em>real webfonts</em>&rdquo;. Currently, these <a href="https://github.com/babsgosgens/persistentgrid/blob/master/scss/pg/helpers/settings/_fonts.scss" target="github">type presets</a> are available. Use the <a href="https://github.com/babsgosgens/persistentgrid/blob/master/scss/pg/helpers/settings/fonts/_example.scss" target="github">example preset</a> to define your own additional Type Lists.
</p>
<p>The <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/documentation/base/typography">Typography module</a> has mixins and methods to work with Type Lists in your projects.</p>
