<p class="intro">Are you a developer that likes to keep his markup free from presentational classes? Persistent Grid provides you with different ways to create columns.</p>

<h2 class="chapter-subheading">Classes or style rules</h2>

<p>Columns can be rendered by:</p>
<ol class="list list-decimal">
	<li>assigning classes (at markup level),</li>
	<li>extending the rendered behavior,</li>
	<li>using mixins.</li>
</ol>
<br>

<h3 class="paragraph-heading">Example: columns by assigning classes</h3>
<p>Using classes<sup>1)</sup> is the simplest way of assigning columns to your markup, and - as you can see in the examples below - uses the least amount of code:</p>
<div class="gist" data-id="6200190"></div>
<p><small><sup>1)</sup> Persistent Grid will produce column styles<sup>1)</sup> for widths as specified in the settings for the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/documentation/grid/">Grid module</a>. The default settings include half, third and fourth column-widths (and their respective counter parts). With these three simple column widths alone, a myriad of layouts is possible (see: <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/blog/grid/2013/08/31/layout-examples-with-persistent-grid.html">Layout examples with Persistent Grid</a>).</small></p>

<h3 class="paragraph-heading">Example: columns by extending classes</h3>
<p>Extending classes can be useful but beware - it can produce bloated stylesheets in the blink of an eye. The first pane shows the markup, the second the SCSS and the third pane shows the compiled CSS:</p>
<div class="gist" data-id="6200198"></div>

<h3 class="paragraph-heading">Example: columns by using mixins</h3>
<p>Both extending and using mixins will keep your markup clean, but mixins provide a way to produce alternate columns on the fly:</p>
<div class="gist" data-id="6200210"></div>

<p>In any given project, you will likely use a mixture of these three methods. The bottom line is this: Persistant Grid does not enforce any particular method - it is totally up to you.</p>
