		<p class="intro">The Reference Manual is split up into sections corresponding to the parts that make up Persistent Grid. These parts are: <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/documentation/grid/">Grid</a>, <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/documentation/base/typography/">Base</a>, <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/documentation/modules/">Modules</a> and <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/documentation/helpers/">Helpers</a>.</p>
		<p>Each section has a full reference on each of its modules. Each module is organized in the same way, consisting of <code>helpers</code>, <code>settings</code> and <code>behavior</code>:</p>

		<aside>

		<h2 class="paragraph-heading">Helpers</h3>
		<p>Helpers is the general terminology for module mixins and module functions. They are assigned with module specific tasks. Helpers are always loaded first.</p>

		<h2 class="paragraph-heading">Settings</h3>
		<p>Each module contains it&rsquo;s own module specific settings. Settings are loaded before behavior and can be overridden by your project settings.</p>

		<h2 class="paragraph-heading">Behavior</h3>
		<p>Behavior is what&rsquo;s actually outputting style rules - if any. Behavior is controlled by the settings, and only behavior that will be used is compiled. Behavior is loaded last so that any changes to the settings can be applied before the styles are compiled.</p>
