# The Persistent Grid
===================

More info can be found here: [http://babsgosgens.github.com/persistent-grid](http://babsgosgens.github.com/persistent-grid/)

The Persistent Grid is a very lightweight and simple, responsive grid. It is still in its early stages and I'm currently test driving it.

Feel free to use it. I would appreciate any feedback you may have.

## Recent changes
Include mixins for easy 'mixing' of column behavior. Example use:

.myclass {
	@include column(1/2);
	@include parentBehavior();
}

For more info on the included mixins, view: [https://github.com/babsgosgens/persistent-grid/blob/master/sass/persistent-grid/_mixins.scss]https://github.com/babsgosgens/persistent-grid/blob/master/sass/persistent-grid/_mixins.scss
