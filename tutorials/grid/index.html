			<p>Persistent Grid is a configurable grid that is not restricted to any fixed number of columns. The module's base behaviour will only render the column styles as defined in the <code>$column-widths</code> array. Columns can be nested to any depth with consistent column spacing - no matter how deeply nested the column is. For a typical eight or twelve column grid, you will usually only need to provide a few widths and achieve more complex layouts by combining them. Examples are provided below.</p>
			<p>Persistent Grid uses padding for column spacing. That way, you can apply backgrounds and have them stretch beyond the column&#39;s content. If you need to, you can swap padding with margin (using the provided mixins).</p>
			<p>For nested containers, you can either use the container class which will render a column without padding, or apply an additional class of container to remove the padding.</p>
