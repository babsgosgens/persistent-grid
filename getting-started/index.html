				<p>Persistent Grid is a modular CSS framework built with <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">SASS</a> and <a href="http://compass-style.org/">Compass</a>. It comes in three flavours: <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/base/grid"><em>Grid</em></a>, <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/base"><em>Base</em></a> and <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/extended"><em>Extended</em></a>.</p>
				<h3 class="chapter-subheading">Grid</h3>
				<p>Grid is the most basic execution of Persistant Grid. If you are only interested in the layout system then this is your cup of tea.</p>
				<h3 class="chapter-subheading">Base</h3>
				<p>Basic provides the grid and a set of base styles to build your project on. It includes a Reset module, a Type module and a bunch of (very useful) base styles. If you're looking for a solid base to start from, then this is probably your flavour of choice.</p>
				<h3 class="chapter-subheading">Extended</h3>
				<p>Framework<sup>1)</sup> is an extension to Base. It provides a collection of commonly used UI elements like buttons, forms, tabs and a whole lot more. And you don't have to stick with what's there either. You can add as well as override any of the framework modules. More information is to come&hellip;</p>
				<p><sup>1)</sup> <small>Framework is still under heavy construction.</small></p>

					<h2 class="chapter-subheading">Installing Persistent Grid (pre-alpha)</h2>
					<p>During the development of Persistent Grid (or at least until a first release candidate) you can install Persistent Grid as an Ad-Hoc Compass extension. Ad-Hoc extensions reside in a directory named <code>extensions</code> in the root of your Compass project.</p>
					<p><small>Persistent Grid will be available as a gem as soon as it's ready to ship.</small></p>
				</aside>

				<h3 class="chapter-subheading">Adding Persistent Grid to your Compass project</h3>
				<p>Create a directory named <code>extensions</code> in the root of your Compass project directory.</p>
				<p><small>Unless of course directory does already exist.</small></p>

				<h4 class="paragraph-heading lower-alpha">Install using git submodule</h4>
				<p>If you are using git for version control, you may want to add Persistent Grid as a submodule to your project. Using the command line, from the root of your repository, type: <div class="gist" data-id="6230518"></div><p/>
				
				<p><small>Make sure to replace "path_to_your_compass_directory" with the actual path to your Compass directory.</small></p>

				<h4 class="paragraph-heading lower-alpha">Install using an archive</h4>
				<p>You can also add Persistent Grid by extracting an <a href="https://github.com/babsgosgens/persistentgrid/archive/master.zip">archived copy</a> of Persistent Grid into the extensions directory. Rename the extracted directory from <code>persistentgrid-master</code> to <code>persistentgrid</code>.</p>

				<br>
				<h3 class="chapter-subheading">Checking that Persistent Grid is installed succesfully</h3>
				<p>Using the command line, from the root directory of your Compass project, type: <div class="gist" data-id="6230560"></div></p>
				<p>You should now see Persistent Grid listed among your other available extensions: <div class="gist" data-id="6230579"></div></p>

				<p>For more information on Compass Ad-Hoc extensions, please visit <a href="http://compass-style.org/help/tutorials/extensions/">http://compass-style.org/help/tutorials/extensions/</a>. Instructions on starting a bare Compass project is also listed there.</p>

				<h2 class="chapter-subheading">Using Persistent Grid (pre-alpha)</h2>

				<p>Make sure you have Persistent Grid <a href="#installation">installed</a>.</p>
				
				<p>For a real implementation of Persistent Grid Framework, check <a href="https://github.com/babsgosgens/persistentgrid/tree/gh-pages">Persistent Grid's project pages on Github</a>.</p>

				<h3 class="paragraph-heading">Grid</h3>
				<p>At the time of writing, the easiest way is to copy <a href="https://github.com/babsgosgens/persistentgrid/blob/master/templates/grid/screen.scss">screen.scss</a> from the <code>grid</code> template into your sass (or scss) directory. Alternatively, you can copy/paste this into a (new) file in your Compass project:</p>
				<div class="gist" data-id="6230736"></div>
				<p><small>The grid template can be found in <code>path_to_your_compass_directory/extensions/persistentgrid/templates</code></small></p>

				<h3 class="paragraph-heading">Base</h3>
				<p>At the time of writing, the easiest way is to copy <a href="https://github.com/babsgosgens/persistentgrid/blob/master/templates/base/screen.scss">screen.scss</a> from the <code>base</code> template into your sass (or scss) directory. Alternatively, you can copy/paste this into a (new) file in your Compass project:</p>
