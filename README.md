# The Persistent Grid

More info can be found here: [http://babsgosgens.github.com/persistent-grid](http://babsgosgens.github.com/persistent-grid/)

The Persistent Grid is a very lightweight and simple, responsive grid. It is still in its early stages and I'm currently test driving it.

Feel free to use it. I would appreciate any feedback you may have.
